# 🍽️ Automated Food Image Classification

This project implements an automated food image classification system using pre-trained deep learning models such as **SqueezeNet** and **VGG16**. The system processes food images and classifies them into various categories using transfer learning techniques.

## 📂 Models Used

- `SqueezeNet.mat` – Lightweight deep learning model optimized for performance on edge devices.
- `VGG16net.mat` – A deeper convolutional neural network model offering higher classification accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Python**
- **Matplotlib** – For visualizing results and data
- (Optional: NumPy, OpenCV, SciPy depending on implementation)
